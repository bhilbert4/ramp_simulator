#position can be x,y or RA,Dec. If x,y, put the phrase 'position_pixels' in the top
#line of the file. Velocity can be in units of pix/hour or arcsec/hour.
#If using pix/sec, place 'velocity_pixels' in the second line of the file.
#Note that if using velocities of pix/hour, the results will not be 
#strictly correct because in reality distortion will cause object's
#velocities to vary in pixels/hour. Velocities in arcsec/hour will be
#constant.
